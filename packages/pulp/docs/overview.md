## Overview

Pulp is a build system designed to perform a handful of tasks:

- Bind tasks to the command-line
- Supply command-line arguments to the tasks
- Run a tasks dependencies
- Allow a task to communicate progress to the reporter

It was designed to be a less bulky alternative to `gulp` and similar tools
